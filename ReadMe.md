Fiscal Data Website 

Our website, Fiscal Data Website, enables users to search fiscal data on 
government spending. In addition, we provide stock market data on different 
companies. Lastly, users have the ability to search for a specific company's 
fiscal information, making our website a unique and versatile way to analyze 
financial data.

Our target users are those on Google Chrome. We chose this browser due to its
popularity and how familiar our team was with its functionalities. Our target 
demographic is investors, analysts, researchers, policymakers or even students, 
as we offer an all-in-one platform to analyze financial data and make informed
decisions.
