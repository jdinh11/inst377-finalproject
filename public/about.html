            <h1> ABOUT US </h1>
            <p id="about-text"> We are dedicated to making government fiscal data accessible and understandable for everyone. 
            Transparency is crucial for democratic engagement, but the complexity of financial information 
            often acts as a barrier. Our mission is to simplify this data, empowering citizens, policymakers, 
            and financial institutions to make informed decisions and engage in meaningful discussions about 
            government finances. Our data comes from the Fiscal Data Treasury API, which includes key datasets 
            like the Monthly Statement of Public Debt (MSPD) and the Monthly Treasury Statement. </p>
