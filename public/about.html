                We are dedicated to making government fiscal data accessible and understandable for everyone. 
            Transparency is crucial for democratic engagement, but the complexity of financial information 
            often acts as a barrier. Our mission is to simplify this data, empowering citizens, policymakers, 
            and financial institutions to make informed decisions and engage in meaningful discussions about 
            government finances. 
            <br><br>
            Our data comes from the Fiscal Data Treasury API, which includes the Financial Report 
            of the U.S. Government dataset. Additionally, we use a Supabase database 
            to provide stock information. Our web application offers a user-friendly 
            interface to access U.S. government financial data. 
            <br><br>
            Key features include a minimal interface and interactive charts for visualizing data in 
            a digestible format. We also serve a variety of stakeholders which include the general public, policymakers, and financial institutions by 
            enhancing the ability to participate in democrative processes with better information, supporting data driven decision making and effective public communication
            and providing clear insights into government spending to aid in financial forecasting and investment decisions.
